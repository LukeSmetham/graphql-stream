# `graphql-feeds`
GraphQL Schema & Utils for Stream Feeds.

> ⚠️ Warning
> This lib is still in development and considered WIP.

Currently this library wraps the Stream JS SDK for Node. Still deciding on the best approach between that and directly wrapping the REST API using `phin` but ultimately the Schema syntax would be identical, just the implementation in the resolvers would change.
